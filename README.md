To facilitate our time series forecasting endeavor, I will leverage gold pricing data from Quandl. Quandl stands as a versatile platform hosting a wealth of financial, economic, and alternative datasets. Accessing publicly shared datasets on Quandl can be accomplished using libraries such as pandas-datareader and quandl (Quandl's native library). The following code snippet presents a succinct one-liner to acquire gold pricing information dating back to the 1970s:
