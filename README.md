## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
sequential_model = Sequential()

sequential_model.add(Dense(256, input_shape=(28 * 28 * 1,), 
                           activation='sigmoid'))
                           
sequential_model.add(Dense(128, activation='sigmoid'))

sequential_model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))


**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for computer vision developers and engineers, as well as deep learning practitioners looking for go-to solutions to various problems that commonly arise in computer vision. You will discover how to employ modern machine learning (ML) techniques and deep learning architectures to perform a plethora of computer vision tasks. Basic knowledge of Python programming and computer vision is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
